In the data processing step, different feature engineering is applied. Each section has comments on what processes are used in the code. After data processing, MinMax Scaling is applied to normalize the feature values within a specific range (e.g., [0, 1]), ensuring that all features contribute equally to the model and improving convergence during training. Various ensemble models, including CatBoost, XGBoost, Bagging with CatBoost, Bagging with XGBoost, and a Voting Classifier, were employed to leverage their strengths in handling complex datasets and improving predictive performance. CatBoost, known for its efficiency with categorical features and ability to minimize overfitting, achieved the best private score with an accuracy of 93.825%. XGBoost, recognized for its capability to handle large datasets while effectively reducing bias and variance, also performed well. Bagging was utilized to combine multiple models (e.g., CatBoost and XGBoost) to reduce variance further. The Voting Classifier, which aggregates predictions from multiple models to enhance overall accuracy by combining their diverse strengths, delivered the best public score with an accuracy of 94.083%. This ensemble approach enabled the identification of the most effective model for both public and private datasets."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Import
